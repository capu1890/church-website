      <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-center">Our Belief</h2>
    <p class="text-center">For many people, “Pentecostal” is a new word. Although 
        it has become much more common in recent years, its roots 
        go back to an ancient Jewish feast and, more recently, 
        to the first outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the earliest Christian 
        believers. Because this initial outpouring of the Spirit took 
        place on the Day of Pentecost (Acts chapter 2), those who 
        experience a similar infilling of the Spirit are known as 
        Pentecostals. They look to the Book of Acts as a guide for how 
        to live out their Christian faith. Many of the key players in 
        Acts were eyewitnesses of the life and teachings of Jesus, and 
        it follows that they would have the clearest insight into the 
        way in which to worship Jesus.A Foundation on the Bible
        Pentecostals believe it is important to be led of the Spirit. However, this desire to be led of the Spirit does not conflict with a high view of 
        the Bible as a primary source for truth. From our belief in an intelligent, loving Creator, we should expect God to reveal His message in writing, 
        the historic medium best suited for precision, preservation, and propagation. When we read, study, and listen to the Bible, we hear the voice of 
        the living Lord speaking to us today. We receive the message that can transform our lives and lead us to eternal life.
        An Appreciation of God’s Identity
        The beautiful message of Scripture is that our Creator became our Savior.

            <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-center">Global Missions</h2>
            <p class="text-center">
                Global Missions exists to proclaim the whole gospel to the whole world by sending forth God-called men and women in obedience to the 
                great commission. “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark 16:15). Its objectives are as follows:
                1. To send forth God-called missionaries into all the world to preach the gospel of the kingdom to every creature;
                2. To train national workers and ministers that they might, in fulfillment of the great commission, be able to evangelize and give leadership to 
                the churches among their own people and in missionary outreach to other nations;
                3. To produce under God, self-governing national churches in every country according to the apostolic pattern;
                4. To establish an international fellowship of the United Pentecostal Church. National churches shall be encouraged to maintain the closest fraternal 
                fellowship with the United Pentecostal Church International in the United States and Canada and with United Pentecostal Churches worldwide;
                5. To create, by the power of the Word of God and the working of the Holy Spirit, a love for truth and holiness that will bind the church to the heart 
                of God and produce the bride of Christ from among every nation, tribe, and tongue in the whole world (Revelation 5:9).
                Being aware of the human impossibility of the task, we put our trust in God, His power and His Word, and seek to establish a center of operations in 
                every land from which national workers and ministers are sent forth. The missionary must be aware of the fact that he alone cannot fully accomplish that 
                which must be done; therefore, he must pray and trust God to add to the church capable nationals who will bring to completion the full evangelization of 
                each country and thereby the whole world.
